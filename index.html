            <h2 class="greeting">Hello, I'm Jayme!</h2>
            <p class="description">Having spent the past decade igniting a passion for Math in students, 
                I recently completed the Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly Singapore. 
                While I love to simplify complex topics and share data-driven insights, 
                I'm also drawn to the intricacies of machine learning and optimizing models. 
                I'm eager to leverage this blend of skills to contribute meaningful work and make a positive impact.</p>

            </div>    
            <p class="post-description">This project aims to build an image recognition model for handwritten Chinese characters and 
    deploy it to Streamlit, so that we can assist students and non-Chinese learners better with their learning of the Chinese language.
    The <a href="https://github.com/jaymezhangjy/hanzi_hero">first repository</a> provides all the processes and codes needed to build the image recognition model, 
    whereas the <a href="https://github.com/jaymezhangjy/hanzi_hero_streamlit">second repository</a> focuses on deploying the trained model to a user interface using Streamlit Cloud. 
    The user interface can be accessed via this link: <a href="https://hanzi-hero.streamlit.app/">https://hanzi-hero.streamlit.app/</a>. </p>

            </div>    
            <p class="post-description">Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, a concerning statistic that has persisted for over a century. 
            This project addresses this critical public health issue by developing a heart disease risk prediction model. 
                Our primary objective is to raise awareness of this prevalent condition and encourage early detection, a crucial factor in mitigating risk. 
                We utilized data from the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2022.html'>2022 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)</a>, 
                implementing rigorous data cleaning, pre-processing, and imputation techniques to address missing values. 
                An interactive <a href='https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jaymezhangjy/viz/InAHeartbeatPredictionofHeartDiseaseRiskforEarlyDetection/Analysis-HeartDisease'>Tableau dashboard</a> 
                is available for further data exploration.</p>

            </div>    
            <p class="post-description">The alarming rise in online scams demands proactive solutions within communities such as Reddit, and we believe that more can be done. 
                Through the use of Natural Language Processing, we can develop a basic understanding of the linguistic red flags that might signal a potential scam.
                By building a model to distinguish posts from legitimate (<a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/'>r/RandomKindness</a>) and ill-intentioned (<a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/'>r/Scams</a>) subreddits, 
                we aim to empower Reddit moderators to efficiently identify and remove harmful content, ultimately safeguarding their communities.</p>
